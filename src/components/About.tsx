          I developed my interest in and passion for software engineering after college, when I
          discovered that I could fuse my love of tinkering and editing ideas with my love of taking
          in and applying new information in novel ways. Before that, I was a sociology student at
          Hunter College. Iâ€™ve always had a passion for learning about and engaging with people, so
          my education really helped me to gain some knowledge about structural issues in society
          and how to critique systems.

          Right now I am focusing on experimenting with web technologies to figure out ways to build
          tools and I and others can use to learn more deliberately. I made a prototype data
          structure visualizer that helps instructors and students to have a better grasp of the
          data structures they are using, like arrays, hash maps, and binary trees, and visualize
          those structures in front of them while they are teaching or working. If I can build
          better tools to foster communication and learning, I hope that those tools could be used
          to help people clarify their ideas and spread them more effectively.{' '}

          In the long term, I am orienting myself around becoming a better thinker and communicator
          by honing my software development and comedy skills. I am doing this to put myself in a
          position to learn from and engage with as many people as possible with clarity and
          honesty.
